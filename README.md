# ðŸ§­ Path Navigator â€“ Strategy Design Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the use of the **Strategy Design Pattern** in Java through a simple example of a path-finding system that dynamically selects an algorithm based on the **transportation mode** (`WALK`, `BIKE`, `CAR`).

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

In real-world apps like Google Maps, users can choose how they want to travel. Each mode of transport (walk, bike, car) uses a different **pathfinding strategy**.

This project mimics that behavior using:

- **Strategy Pattern** to switch algorithms at runtime.
  
- **Factory Pattern** to decide which strategy to use.
  
- A clean separation of concerns using interfaces and enums.

```bash

â”œâ”€â”€ PathFindingAlgorithm.java        # Strategy interface
â”œâ”€â”€ WalkPathFindingAlgorithm.java   # Strategy 1
â”œâ”€â”€ BikePathFindingAlgorithm.java   # Strategy 2
â”œâ”€â”€ CarPathFindingAlgorithm.java    # Strategy 3
â”œâ”€â”€ PathNavigatorFactory.java       # Factory to choose strategy
â”œâ”€â”€ PathNavigator.java              # Context that uses strategies
â””â”€â”€ TransportMode.java              # Enum to represent transport modes

ðŸ§  Design Patterns Used

âœ… Strategy Pattern:

Encapsulates a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable. Each algorithm (walk, bike, car) implements a common interface.

âœ… Factory Pattern:

Selects and provides the correct strategy instance based on the transport mode. Keeps strategy selection logic separate from the usage.
